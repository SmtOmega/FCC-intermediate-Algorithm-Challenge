The Freecodecamp intermediate algorithm challenge is one of the challenge that in FCC curriculum,
this challenge will prepare an individual to complete the final challenge for the JavaScript Algorithm
and Data structure certificatio.

    I will be writing and explaining my solution for proper documentation

Question 1 of FCC intermediate Algorithm challenge: Sum All Numbers in a Range

    We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the 
    numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.

solution:

 So according to the challenge we will be provided with an array with two number, and will be required
 to write a function that will sum those two numbers and all numbers between them. also the numbers can
 come in any order.
     Here is my solution:

        function sumAll(arr) {
            arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
            let sumarr = 0;
            for (let i = arr[0]; i <= arr[1]; i++){
                sumarr = sumarr + i
             }
            return sumarr;
        }

        sumAll([1, 4]);

    Explaination:

        First we need to sort the other of the array to make it easy to iterate over  the numbers from a lowest number
        to the highest, the sort() method that accept the comparism function does the sorting of the number.
        the for accept the lowest number as the first value and the highest number as the last value. on each iteration
        the value are added to the variable sumarr and the function return the final value of sumarr.

Question 2 of FCC intermediate Algorithm challenge: Diff Two Arrays

    Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. 
    In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

Solution:
    Here we ask to comare the content of two arrays and extract the item that are not common between both arrays, that
    is what is in array1 that is not in array2 and vice versa
        
        Here is my first solution:

            function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
                var newArr = [];
                for (let i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++){
                    if(arr1.includes(arr2[i])=== false){
                        newArr.push(arr2[i])
                        }
                    }
                for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++){
                    if(arr2.includes(arr1[i]) === false){
                        newArr.push(arr1[i])
                        }
                    } 
                return newArr
            }
        Explaination:

            Thinking about the problem, we have two arrays to compare and extract the items are that are not common
            we need to compare the array1 with array2 and extract element in array1 not find in array2 and append it 
            to the empty array declared. to solve this problem I make use of for loop to iterate over the content of 
            an array, compared each element with element in the second array using the includes() method.
            The first for loop iterate over the element in array2 and the if conditional compared that with the 
            element in array1. if element is found in array2 that is not in array then that element is pushed to the newArr
            The second for loop did the same thing as explained above but these time we iterate over the array1 and if conditional
            statement compared the element in array1 that is not in array2 and then push the element to the newArr.

        Here is my second solution:
            We going to make use of new function and do and array parameter swap when we call the function inside of the main
            function.

                function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
                    var newArr = []
                    function arraySwap(array1, array2){
                        for(let i = 0; i< array1.length; i++){
                            if(array2.includes(array1[i]) === false){
                                newArr.push(array1[i])
                            } 
                        }
                    }
                    arraySwap(arr1, arr2)
                    arraySwap(arr2, arr1)
                    return newArr
                }

        Explaination:

            This solution allows you to remove the redudancy of using to for loop by calling the function that accept 
            the array in any order twice within the function. note that arr1 in the first arraySwap function call is array1
            while arr2 in the second arraySwap call becomes array1
 
Question 3 of FCC intermediate Algorithm challenge: Seek and Destroy
    You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. 
    Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

Solution:
    Here we asked to write a function that compares an array(first argument in the function) with other arguments of the function
    and delete only the element that are common in the array and the other argument
     Here is my solution:

        function destroyer(arr) {
            let newArr = []
            let argumentsVal = []
            for(let i = 1; i <arguments.length; i++){
                argumentsVal.push(arguments[i])
                }
            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
                 if(argumentsVal.includes(arr[i]) === false){
                    newArr.push(arr[i])
                    }
                }
            return newArr
            }

    Explaination:

        Now the arguments in a function are stored in form of array, for example let say we have a function name
        func1([1,2, 3, 4],3, 4) now function func1 has the argument stored in the function like [[1, 2, 3, 4], 3, 4]. so from the
        question the index position 0 is for the array and the index position 1 till the end of the argument is for the 
        remaining argument. we declared two new array called newArr and argumentsVal, the newArr will be used to store element
        not in the argument from index 1 to the end. The first for loop iterate over the argument in the function starting
        at index 1 and push the value of the argument at each index into the argumentsVal array.
        The second for loop is used to compare the element in the arr array with element in the argumentsVal array and store 
        the element not common in both array inside newArr and newArr will be returne. forexample the func1([1, 2,3, 4] 3, 4)
        will return the array [1, 2]

Question 4 of FCC intermediate Algorithm challenge: Pig Latin

    Pig Latin is a way of altering English Words. The rules are as follows:

    - If a word begins with a consonant, take the first consonant or consonant cluster, move it to the end of the word,
      and add "ay" to it.
    - If a word begins with a vowel, just add "way" at the end.

    Solution:

        Here we ask to write a function that accept a word and we can alter that word base the specification above.

            function translatePigLatin(str) {
                let arr = str.split('')
                let vowelreg = /[aieou]/gi
                if(arr[0].match(vowelreg)){
                     return arr.join('') + 'way'
                     }
                else {
                    return str.replace(/([^aieou]+)(.*)/gi, '$2$1')+ 'ay'
                    }
                }

    Explaination:
        We declare a function called translatePigLatin, the function accept a string parameter called str.
        we also declared an array called arr and then we split the str into character using the split method, this character
        are stored in the array arr. then we create a RegEx to check if a character at the beginning of word is a vowel, if 
        the character is a vowel, we then join all character in the array and add the string 'way' to it end, otherwise, if the 
        first character is not an array we use the replace method and the RegEx "/([^aieou]+)(.*)/gi, '$2$1')" to group all
        character before the first vowel(([^aieou]+)) store it in $1 and and every character from the vowel to end(.*) store it 
        in the $2 and add both together and then the replace method replaces the str with value of '$2$1' and then 'ay' is added 
        to it.

Question 5 of FCC intermediate Algorithm challenge: Search and replace
    
    Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.

    Solution:
        
        We ask to write a function that takes three arguments, the first argument a sentence, the second and third
        argument are words. the function search through the first argument(sentence) and check if the second argument 
        is present, if it is, then it replace the second argument with the third. also it check if the second argument 
        first character is captilize and thus captilize the first character of the third argument.

            function myReplace(str, before, after) {
                let arrStr = str.split(" ")
                for(let i = 0; i < arrStr.length; i++){
                if(before === arrStr[i]){
                    if(arrStr[i].charAt(0).match(/([A-Z])+/)){
                        let val = after.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + after.slice(1)
                        arrStr[i] = val
                         }
                    else{
                        arrStr[i] = after
                         }

                        }
                    }
                return arrStr.join(' ');
                }

    Explaination:

        First we declared a variable called arrStr, and then we split the first argument into array of string and stored
        them in the arrStr, then we iterate over the array of string and check if there is any word that is eqaul to the 
        second argument, if that word exist then we check the first character of the string using the charAt method to See
        if the word has a captilize first character, this is done using the RegEx "/([A-Z])+/". once we satisfy all the
        condition when then replace the word with the third argument and use the join method to convert back the array 
        sentence.
